### Task1

---

Write a function solution that, given an integer N, returns a string consists of N lowercase letters (a-z) such that each letter occurs an odd number of times. We only care about occurrences of letters that appear at least once in the result.



Examples:

1. Given N = 4, the function may return "code"(each of the letters "c", "o", "d","e" occurs once). Other correct answers are "cats", "uutu" or "xxxy".
2. Given N = 7, the function may return "gwgtgww" ("g" and "w" occur three times each and "t" occurs onece). 
3. Given N =1 the function may return "z".



write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions

* N is an integer within the range [1 .. 20,0000]
